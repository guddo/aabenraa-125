The SnapEngage module lets you add the SnapEngage widget to your site.

SnapEngage is a simple and streamlined live chat service. Engage with
your visitors and improve your conversion, turning your website
visitors into customers. Live chat with your visitors from your
favorite instant messenger or mobile device and easily integrate with
your existing CRM or Helpdesk solution.

The code is heavily inspired by the Google Analytics module.

# Installation

Create an account at www.snapengage.com, install the module and go to
"Administration > Configuration > System > SnapEngage" where you can
enter your widget ID. The widget will now appear on your pages.

# Further configuration

At "Administration > Configuration > System > SnapEngage" it is also
possible to restrict the widget to only be displayed for specific
roles and/or on specific pages.

Administration of the above settings can be delegated to a role of
your choice by setting the "Administer SnapEngage" permission.

The maintainers are not affiliated with SnapEngage.
